# car_black_box
THIS IS AN EMBEDDED SYSTEMS BASED PROJECT USING THE PIC18F4580.
The Car Black Box project aims to develop a sophisticated data logging and monitoring system for vehicles, utilizing the PIC18F4580 microcontroller in conjunction with a matrix keypad, Character LCD (CLCD) display, Real-Time Clock (RTC), and Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).
This integrated solution provides a comprehensive platform for capturing, displaying, and analyzing crucial vehicle data.

for the above code use only the .c and .h file and the makefile to build the file

software requirment :
1. MPLAB X IDE : editor to write a code
2. XC8 Compiler : to exectue the code we need the compiler
3. tinyboot loader : to dump the code in the micro-controller
4. tera term : to view the output from the UART/RS323 
5. PIC18F4580 by Micro-chip

Steps to Execute the project
1. the header files consists of the all the macro defined relate to the register and the peripherials
2. data is given for the micro-contorller so refer for the register configuration
3. code will display the real time and event and speed 
4. all the saved logs are downloaded and viewed in the tera term software 
5. just built the code and run it.
